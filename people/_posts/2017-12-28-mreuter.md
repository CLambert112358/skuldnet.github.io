Post-doc in Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

The main goal of my current research is to investigate how sensory substitution devices shape subjective content of perceptual experience. Iâ€™m especially interested in phenomenology of experience during spatial representation and object recognition and enactive approach applied to studies on sensory substitution.

Research interests:
- Sensory substitution
- Subjective measures of consciousness
- Spatial representation
- Phenomenological, enactive & sensorimotor approaches
- Philosophy of mind & cognitive science
- Higher-order theories of consciousness
