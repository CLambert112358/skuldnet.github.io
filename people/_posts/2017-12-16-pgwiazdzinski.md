I'm an interdisciplinary researcher with a background in philosophy and cognitive science. My research interest circle around 4E cognition, phenomenology (applied to empirical endeavor and theoretical as well), consciousness studies and interplay between those fields. I'm passionate about philosophical underpinnings of modern theories of mind and cognition and different ways of incorporating those into science, art and technology. 

Research interest:
– neurophenomenology 
– cognitive Science
– philosophy of Mind 
– enactive / embodied / extended / embedded Cognition 
– sensory Substitution
