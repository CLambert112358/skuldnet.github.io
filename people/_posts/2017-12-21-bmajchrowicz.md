PhD student in the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

Currently I am working on sensory substitution, trying to find out how its implementation shapes subjective experience. I am also interested in sense of agency and intentionality, both in health and disease, and in the near future I plan to investigate what external and internal factors influence these phenomena.
          
Research interests:
– sense of agency
– intentional binding
– sensory substitution
– cognition in schizophrenia and psychosis
– enactive, sensorimotor and phenomenological approaches
– philosophy of psychology & mind
