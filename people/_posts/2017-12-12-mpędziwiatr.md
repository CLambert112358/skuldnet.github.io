PhD student in Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC)

My ongoing collaboration with C-Lab focuses on investigating how binocular rivalry is influenced by information from other modalities (hearing and touch). In our research we use novel, sophisticated stimuli and combine different indicators of conscious visual experience: involuntary eye movements (optokinetic reflex) and participants’ responses. Apart from that, I am mainly interested in the role of top-down processes in visual perception. My current research aims to answer the question of how they contribute to determining visual salience of different regions of visual scenes.

Research interests:
– top-down influences on visual perception
– binocular rivalry
– visual salience
– objective measures of consciousness
